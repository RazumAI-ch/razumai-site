        [Pilots are easy, production is hard, what matters most is the speed of innovation]

        Continuous interactions with our system make the system smarter over time. Each correction, each flagged record,
        and each validation helps the AI recognize similar issues more effectively in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        This creates a <strong>network effect</strong>: the data itself never leaves your environment, but the <strong>learnings do</strong>.
        Every site and every company benefits from what others have taught the system. In-house tools can fix local problems,
        but they cannot share knowledge industry-wide. By working through RazumAI, your team’s efforts raise quality standards beyond your own walls,
        accelerating safer outcomes for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is possible because our solutions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning">federated by design</a>.
        Data stays on-prem or in your secure cloud environment, while only learned patterns are shared.
        Much like Google Search improves with every user interaction, our base model becomes stronger as more companies use it —
        continuously improving pharma’s ability to safeguard data quality and patient safety.

            The arrival of <strong>AI</strong> is like opening <strong>Pandora’s box</strong> — for good or for bad, it’s already here
            and there is no going back. Our role is to make sure that in pharma, this force is handled with rigor and care.
            The orange glow in our logo symbolizes AI’s transformative energy, while the blue frame reflects pharma’s strict boundaries and standards.

            Look closer: on the left is an <strong>R</strong> for Razum, on the right an artistic <strong>AI</strong>, and on the lid the structure of
            <strong>myoglobin</strong> — the first solved protein, and a homage to <strong>Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold</strong> breakthrough.
            That advance reshaped how the world approaches <strong>drug discovery</strong> and demonstrated the power of AI in medicine.
            In the same spirit, we aim to reshape <strong>data quality in pharma</strong> — not by stopping the box from opening,
            but by ensuring what comes out is safe and valuable.
