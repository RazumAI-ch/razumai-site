        [Pilots are easy, production is hard, what matters most is the speed of innovation]

      <p>
        Continuous interactions with our system make the system smarter over time. Each correction, each flagged record,
        and each validation helps the AI recognize similar issues more effectively in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        This creates a <strong>network effect</strong>: the data itself never leaves your environment, but the <strong>learnings do</strong>.
        Every site and every company benefits from what others have taught the system. In-house tools can fix local problems,
        but they cannot share knowledge industry-wide. By working through RazumAI, your team’s efforts raise quality standards beyond your own walls,
        accelerating safer outcomes for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is possible because our solutions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning">federated by design</a>.
        Data stays on-prem or in your secure cloud environment, while only learned patterns are shared.
        Much like Google Search improves with every user interaction, our base model becomes stronger as more companies use it —
        continuously improving pharma’s ability to safeguard data quality and patient safety.

            Our logo represents a <strong>Pandora’s box with AI inside</strong> — the orange color for AI transformative energy,
            the blue frame for pharma’s rigor and care, and the lid open to show that, for good or for bad, the box of AI is already open and there is no going back.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the outside you can see the letters <strong>R</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>, while on the lid sits <strong>myoglobin</strong> —
            the first protein ever solved, chosen because it is both iconic and simple enough to be visualized.
            Myoglobin is a deliberate <strong>homage to Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold</strong>, which proved that AI could solve protein folding at scale
            and revolutionize biology and medicine. In the same spirit, we believe AI can transform <strong>pharma data quality</strong>,
            making it safe, productive, and cost-efficient.
