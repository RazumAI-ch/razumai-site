      <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Accelerating AI adoption in Pharma</p>
      <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> <em>Pilots are easy, production is hard. What matters most is the speed of innovation.</em></p>

      <p>
        We are an <strong>AI-only</strong> company. Every product, method, and integration we ship is centered on AI and built for regulated reality.
        Our systems are <strong>federated by design</strong>: data stays on-prem or in your VPC, while only learned patterns are shared.
        Much like Google Search, every interaction strengthens the base model without exposing private content, so quality continuously
        improves across sites and companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe AI is the <strong>best architecture for pharma data quality</strong>. The alternative—armies of scripts and rule-based setups—creates complexity that
        doesn’t scale. Just as automotive moved from hand-coding rules to AI for self-driving, pharma will follow the same path. GxP experts can simply flag compromised
        records, and the system will remember, generalize, and extrapolate that knowledge across sites and even data structures.
      </p>

          <p>
            The arrival of <strong>AI</strong> is like opening <strong>Pandora’s box</strong>—for good or for bad, it’s already here, and no one can close it again.
            Our role is to make sure that in pharma, this force is handled with rigor and care. The orange glow in our logo symbolizes AI’s transformative energy,
            while the blue frame reflects pharma’s strict boundaries and standards.

            Look closer: on the left is an <strong>R</strong> for Razum, on the right an artistic <strong>AI</strong>, and on the lid the structure of
            <strong>myoglobin</strong>—the first solved protein, and a homage to <strong>Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold breakthrough</strong>. That advance reshaped
            how the world approaches <strong>drug discovery</strong> and demonstrated the power of AI in medicine. In the same spirit, we aim to reshape
            <strong>data quality in pharma</strong>—not by stopping the box from opening, but by ensuring what comes out is safe and valuable.
