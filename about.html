      <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Accelerating AI adoption in Pharma</p>
      <p><strong>Slogan:</strong> <em>Pilots are easy, production is hard. What matters most is the speed of innovation.</em></p>

      <p>
        We are an <strong>AI-only</strong> company. Every product, method, and integration we ship is centered on AI and built for regulated reality.
        Our systems are <strong>federated by design</strong>: data stays on-prem or in your VPC, while only learned patterns are shared.
        Much like Google Search, every interaction strengthens the base model without exposing private content, so quality continuously
        improves across sites and companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe AI is the <strong>best architecture for pharma data quality</strong>. The alternative—armies of scripts and rule-based setups—creates complexity that
        doesn’t scale. Just as automotive moved from hand-coding rules to AI for self-driving, pharma will follow the same path. GxP experts can simply flag compromised
        records, and the system will remember, generalize, and extrapolate that knowledge across sites and even data structures.
      </p>

          <p>
            Our logo is <strong>Pandora's box—hopefully the good one</strong>. The orange glow is AI's transformative energy; the blue frame reflects pharma's rigor.
            On the left, an <strong>R</strong> stands for Razum; on the right, an artistic <strong>AI</strong>; and on the lid, the structure of <strong>myoglobin</strong>—
            the first solved protein, and a homage to AlphaFold's breakthrough in biology. Just as AlphaFold reshaped drug discovery, we aim to reshape
            <strong>data quality in pharma</strong>.
