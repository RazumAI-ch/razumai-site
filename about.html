      <!-- Slogan as belief statement -->
      <p class="slogan">
        [Pilots are easy, production is hard, what matters most is the speed of innovation]
      </p>

      <!-- Main copy -->
      <p>
        Continuous interactions with our system make the system smarter over time. Each correction, each flagged record,
        and each validation helps the AI recognize similar issues more effectively in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        This creates a <strong>network effect</strong>: the data itself never leaves your environment, but the <strong>learnings do</strong>.
        Every site and every company benefits from what others have taught the system. In-house tools can fix local problems,
        but they cannot share knowledge industry-wide. By working through RazumAI, your team’s efforts raise quality standards beyond your own walls,
        accelerating safer outcomes for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is possible because our solutions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning">federated by design</a>.
        Data stays on-prem or in your secure cloud environment, while only learned patterns are shared.
        Much like Google Search improves with every user interaction, our base model becomes stronger as more companies use it —
        continuously improving pharma’s ability to safeguard data quality and patient safety.

          <p>
            Our logo represents a <strong>Pandora’s box with AI inside</strong>: orange for AI’s transformative energy,
            blue for pharma’s rigor and care. The lid is open because the box of AI is already open — there is no going back.
            On the outside, you can see <strong>R</strong> on the left and <strong>AI</strong> on the right, rendered as an
            artistic impression within the boundaries of the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the lid sits the structure of <strong>myoglobin</strong>, the first protein ever solved —
            a deliberate <strong>homage to Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold breakthrough</strong>, which proved that AI could
            solve protein structures at scale and transform pharma and medicine. We believe AI can play a similar role
            in <strong>pharma data quality</strong>: safe, productive, and cost-efficient.
